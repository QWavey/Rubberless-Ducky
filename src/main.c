/**
 * @file main.c
 * @brief AT32UC3B1 USB Rubber Ducky firmware — clean rewrite.
 *
 * Reads INJECT.BIN from SD into RAM and interprets it as a sequence of
 * 16-bit big-endian words.  Each word is either an opcode (control flow,
 * DELAY, ATTACKMODE, …) or a raw HID keystroke encoded as
 *
 *     (keycode << 8) | modifier
 *
 * USB profile is forced to HID-only (no mass-storage interface on the host
 * side) — the SD card is read by firmware over SPI, so the host never
 * mounts a drive letter and Windows AutoPlay never fires.
 *
 * Reliability guarantees:
 *   - Every keystroke is press → drain → release → drain.  The host cannot
 *     miss a release, so a modifier (Shift/Ctrl/Alt/GUI) can never get
 *     "stuck" between characters.
 *   - At every dangerous boundary (payload start, before+after a button
 *     press) the firmware sends THREE back-to-back zero reports.  Three
 *     reports across three host poll cycles cannot all be lost.
 *   - The physical button is latched in software: presses that happen
 *     while a STRING is typing are remembered and consumed when
 *     WAIT_FOR_BUTTON_PRESS is reached — the user no longer has to hold
 *     the button until typing finishes.
 *   - bInterval is 1 ms in the endpoint descriptor (see usb_descriptors.c)
 *     so typing runs at host poll speed, not 10× slower.
